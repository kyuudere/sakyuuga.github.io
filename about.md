Hello, this is kyuudere. This is my second blog after my [old one](https://sakyuuga.wordpress.com) got suspended by wordpress. I build this blog using jekyll theme povided by [unix-lab.org](http://www.unix-lab.org/voyager/) and hosting it through github because I want a full control of my site. 

My blog is focused on animation appreciation (or sakuga), specifically for anime (I rarely watch western animation). I also plan to translate sakuga/animation related articles, such as AnimeStyle talk event report, magazine interviews, etc. I might write one or two blog posts about manga or film, maybe even about music videos and such in the future. But I'll keep focusing on anime for now.  

If you like what I've been doing and want to give support, you can find me on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/kyuudere). Feel free to drop by, even a simple "thanks" is enough to keep me motivated! :)
